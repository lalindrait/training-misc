# -aes-256-cbc is what you should use for maximum protection or the 128-bit version; the 3DES (Triple DES) got abandoned some time ago, see Triple DES has been deprecated by NIST in 2017, while AES gets accelerated by all modern CPUs by a lot; you can simply verify if your CPU has the AES-NI instruction set for example using grep aes /proc/cpuinfo; win, win
# -md sha512 is a bit the faster variant of SHA-2 functions family compared to SHA-256 while it might be a bit more secure; win, win, but that likely changes with the new SHA instruction set in modern CPUs
# -pbkdf2: use PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm
# -iter 1000000 is overriding the default count of iterations (which is 10000) for the password

# AES is a block encryption algorithm and thus supports five modes which are as follows:
    # ECB mode: Electronic Code Book mode
    # CBC mode: Cipher Block Chaining mode
    # CFB mode: Cipher Feedback mode
    # OFB mode: Output Feedback mode
    # CTR mode: Counter mode
